# FFGLConvertor
Tool to generate and convert FFGL1.5 to FFGL 2.0 for All video software that support FFGL plugins like Resolume 5,6,7
This was an old python project that have been updated with a UI, and then an OpenGL implementation with the help of Chat GPT.

An FFGL Stand for Free Frame Graphic Library and is a framework that can be used to make plugins for video software like Resolume. Repo is here : https://github.com/resolume/ffgl

Next steps : 
 - Code need a good clean and conform, restructuration. as it was basically a draft that have been continuously updated. A good refactorisation of classes and structure is needed.  with all conformed to pep8
 - Unit tests before factoring
 - Improve workflow between Shader generation and C++ compilation to get the final FFGL

Part 1 : playing with shader in the UI

Part 2 : Load a previous shader file and generate it
